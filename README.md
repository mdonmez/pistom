## Installation

### Requirements
[uv]("https://docs.astral.sh/uv/")

#### (Testing) Run directly with `uvx`:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/mdonmez/pistom.git@master pistom
```

This command is expected to run without any errors.

#### You can add this server as MCP server to any compitable client:

```json
"pistom":{
  "command":"uvx",
  "args":[
    "--from",
    "git+https://github.com/mdonmez/pistom.git@master",
    "pistom"
  ]
}
```

That's it! You don't need to install or update anything; this implementation will always fetch the latest stable, up-to-date server from GitHub.
